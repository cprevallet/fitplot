Requirements
============

Operating System
----------------
Builds are available for Windows 7 (64-bit), Linux Debian 8 (Jessie - 64 bit) and MacOS/OSX (64 bit)

Input devices
-------------

A mouse or trackpad rather than a touchscreen is recommended in order to pan and scroll the graph generated by the application.  A touchscreen may be used other features.

Browser
-------
Fitplot requires access to the internet and a web browser. 

Browser version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In theory, any browser capable of supporting a combination of Plot.ly, Material Design Lite components, and Google Maps Javascript API and Google Charts should be capable of using the application.

In general browsers with the following version numbers or later should be compatible (but see the tested configurations section below):

+ Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or above
+ Mozilla Firefox version 31 or above
+ Google Chrome version 31 or above
+ Apple Safari version 9.1 or above

Browser settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Javascript and cookies must be enabled to use the application.  This is generally the out-of-the-box setting for most modern browsers.

Tested configurations
---------------------
Fitplot has been tested under the following combinations of operating system and browser:

- Microsoft Windows 7 (64 bit build) 
	+ Internet Explorer 11
	+ Firefox 47.0.1
	+ Chrome 51.0.2704.103
- Debian GNU/Linux 8 (Jessie - 64 bit) 
	+ Chrome 51.0.2704.106
	+ Firefox 45.2.0
- Apple Mac OS Sierra version 10.12
	+ Safari 10.0

Input file formats
------------------
Fitplot will display files generated in either Garmin's FIT or TCX formats.

Digital Security
================

Application Integrity
---------------------
In lieu of a "signing certificate" that both Apple and Microsoft support within their respective operating systems, Fitplot is offered with a "message digest" to insure that the application has not been tampered with.  

Background information on message digests and digital certificates (in the context of another fine program known as "Pretty Good Privacy") may be found here:

+ http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/#p12
+ http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/#p14

The following utilities may be executed from the command line to verify the provided message digests upon download.

+ Windows

::

	CertUtil -hashfile [file.ext] MD5

+ MacOS/OSX

::

	md5 -r [file.ext]
	
+ Linux

::

	md5sum [file.ext]

If you are concerned about security, run these utilities on the downloaded application files and be sure the message digest matches.

Why Not Digital Certificates?
-----------------------------
The primary reason is cost.  For a new application with only a few users, this cost is prohibitive.  See the following article:

https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/02/27/the-great-digital-certificate-ripoff/

Open Source
-----------
Fitplot is open source software.   The actual program code for this software to view, download and modify is online at Github. 

https://github.com/cprevallet/fitplot

Fundamentally this is the most meaningful guarantee of data security a software author can offer.


Installation
============

- Windows(64 bit)

Installation is a performed simply by downloading and running Fitplot Windows x64 Setup.exe.  The setup executable will display the license and then prompt for an installation location.  A start menu icon and folder will be created.

- GNU/Linux(64 bit)

Installation is performed by copying the files from the delivery medium and installing into the /opt/fitplot directory on the user's drive.

::

 sudo tar -xvzf fitplot.tgz -C /opt/
 sudo /opt/fitplot/icons/cpfitplot_color.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/
 sudo cp /opt/fitplot/fitplot.desktop /usr/share/applications/

- MacOS/OSX (64 bit)

Installation is performed by downloading the file with the dmg file and single clicking on it.  This should result in a drive icon appearing on the desktop.  Double click on it to open.  


The program needs write access to a temporary directory (typically C:\\Users\\User Name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp on MS Windows) or (/tmp on Linux and OSX) and the installation directory. Nothing else is required.

Running the Application
========================

Fitplot has both a web server and web client.  Both must be loaded into memory in order to use the application.  The procedure to do this depends on the operating system.

- Windows
	+ Start Menu
	+ Fitplot
	+ You will receive a message indicating that the application is an unsigned binary from an unknown developer and asking if you are sure you want to run it. See the Digital Security and Privacy section.

- Linux
	+ From a bash shell: /opt/fitplot/fitplot.sh
	+ From the menu (if desktop file was copied per the installation instructions): /Utilities/Fitplot

- MacOS/OSX
	+ Click or tap with two fingers on fitplot.command to open the application.  
	+ You will receive a message indicating that fitplot.command is from an unknown developer and asking if you are sure you want to open it. This is due to the developer (me) not signing and making it available to the Mac App Store.  See the Digital Security and Privacy section.
	+ Click the open button to begin the application.  
	
A terminal window may appear and the application will start as a tab in the user's default browser displaying the *Stored Runs* portion of the application.  At this juncture, the user may optionally choose to `load a run <Loading Runs_>`_ or `select a run from the database <Selecting a Run_>`_ (if loaded previously).

If the browser client is closed and the server is left running, the user-interface may be generated by opening any supported browser and typing "http://localhost:8080" (without the quotes) into the address bar.

Loading Runs
============

Fitplot needs information on your run in the form of files generated from your Garmin watch in order to display results.  Once `files are available <Make the files available to the PC_>`_ and subsequently `loaded into the application, <Load file(s)_>`_ they are stored internally in a `database <Database_>`_ where they serve as a historical record.  Once stored internally, runs may be used directly by `selecting from a list <Selecting a Run_>`_ without the need to reload them each session.

In addition, there are sample FIT and TCX files provided with the program itself within the directory/folder named "samples".  These files may be loaded to use the application if no additional files are available.


Make the files available to the PC
----------------------------------

Instructions for making a Garmin file available to the PC vary according to the model of the individual device:

- Devices using Ant Agent to download files: Forerunner 50, 60, 70, 310XT, 405, 405CX, 410, 610, 910, 910XT, and Garmin Swim

- Devices using a docking cradle to download files: Forerunner/Edge 205 and 305

- Devices using a USB cable to download files: Forerunner/Edge 10, 110, 210, 220, 620, 500, 510, 705, 800, 810, 1000, and 920XT 

Detailed instructions describing the process of moving the file from the watch to the PC for the numerous models Garmin manufactures is beyond the scope of this document but there are a number of descriptions of the process `available on the Internet <Instructions for your device_>`_.  Newer Garmin devices support the `USB <USB_>`_ option which tends to be less problematic than older Ant Agent transfers.

Once the files are transferred to the PC's hard drive or available via USB continue to `load files. <Load file(s)_>`_.

Instructions for your device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of this writing, owner's manuals for many Garmin devices may be downloaded from here:

	+ https://support.garmin.com/support/manuals/searchManuals.faces?refresh=true
	+ Select Sports & Recreation from the dropdown list
	+ Select Running from the second dropdown list
	+ Select <Your Model> from the third dropdown list

The Garmin learning center has detailed videos as well:

	+ http://www8.garmin.com/learningcenter/


Load file(s)
------------

Once the `application has been started <Running the Application_>`_ and the `files are available <Make the files available to the PC_>`_,  the user may load the files by selecting a circular green target with the figure of a "+".  (On screens with smaller resolutions this may not be visible but the same functionality is available from the "hamburger" menu in the upper left.) 

	+ Pressing either of the above targets will present a file input dialog box. 
	+ Navigate to one of the `folders <File locations_>`_ containing either .FIT or .TCX format files select one or more files to load.  (Selecting more than one file is operating system specific. On Windows or Linux try holding SHIFT or CTRL while selecting.  On Mac try SHIFT+CLICK or CLICK+DRAG). 
	+ Select Open button to begin the upload process.

Once confirmed Fitplot will load the files in parallel.  One or more file upload notification pop-up dialogs will appear in series at the bottom of the browser window indicating the success or failure of the file load(s).  Once the files have loaded, `select a run <Selecting a Run_>`_ to continue. 

Note: It is not recommended to load more than about one month's worth of files (25-30) at one time.  It is possible under some circumstances for files to fail to load if this limit is exceeded.

File locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ANT+ protocol
	+ On Windows computers, the Application Data (AppData) folders are hidden by default and you must enable the display of hidden files before you are able to see these elements.ï»¿ Please see: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7
	+ Windows 2000 and Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\<USERNAME>\\Application Data\\GARMIN\\Devices\\<DEVICE-ID>
	+ Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8: C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\GARMIN\\Devices\\<DEVICE-ID>
	+ Mac OS X: Macintosh HD/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Garmin/Devices/<DEVICE-ID>

.. _USB:
ï»¿
- USB
	+ Connect your Garmin to the USB cable and ensure the cable is plugged into your computer and wait for your computer to recognize the device.  Files may be loaded directly from the watch in this configuration.
	+ <DRIVE>\\Garmin\\Garmin\\Activity\\

Database
--------

Runs are stored internally in a database where they serve as a historical record.  The database is stored in a single file named "fitplot.db" in the (system dependent) application installation directory. This file is transparent to the user and normally of no consequence.  However, there are a few situations where some knowledge of the existence of this file may be helpful.

If the database file is not found on application startup (e.g. the first time the application is used), a blank empty database is created.

If the database file is found on application startup, a backup copy is made in the system-dependent temporary directory as a safeguard.  This file will be called "tmpxxxxxxxxx" where the values for "x" are random numbers between from 0 to 9.  In the event of a missing or corrupted database, manually copying and renaming this file to "fitplot.db" in the installation directory may be sufficient to recover.

Manually copying fitplot.db to another name can serve as a backup strategy.  For example, if the user is only interested in viewing the runs for one year at a time, storing a single year's worth of data and then renaming fitplot.db to fitplot_yyyy.db (while the application is not running, of course) is a viable strategy to store past runs.  This may have the added benefit of avoiding overly long searches from within Fitplot.

Finally, fitplot.db is an SQLite database and its contents may be viewed (and exported) from within compatible applications such as the free `DB Browser for SQLite <http://sqlitebrowser.org/>`_.

Usage
=====

Using the application
---------------------

Selecting a Run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After one or more files have been `loaded <Load file(s)_>`_ into the application, a single run should be selected for visualization or analysis.  This is accomplished in two steps.  

The first step is selecting a pair of dates ("Start" and "End") on the calendar widget provided on the *Stored Runs* tab.  Navigate between months by left clicking the arrows (previous and next) on the calendar header bar and then left-clicking the desired day.  The selected dates will appear in the read-only text boxes below the calendar. The dates represent a range bounding the run(s) of interest.  The earliest ("Start") date is *always* selected first however both dates can be the same if desired (e.g. a single day).  Upon selecting the end date, a table containing all runs falling between the selected dates will be returned along with a bar graph indicating the distances for each run.  The bar graph provides a comparison between runs within the selected dates.  Hovering the mouse over the bars will show values (date, time, distance) for a given run.

The second step is to locate an individual run in the table.  Right click the row containing the run of interest and then click on one of the tabs (*Visualize*, *Summarize*, or *Analyze*) to see information on that run.  Alternatively left-click and select from the pop-up menu. 

Pro tip: Clicking the headers of the table will sort ascending based on distance, date, pace, moving time, and time-of-day.  The bar graph will reflect the new sort order.  This can be handy for locating the longest run or fastest paced run in a given week or month for example.

Enter user-specific settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next the run will be processed and the results displayed upon selecting one of the tabs (*Visualize*, *Summarize*, *Analyze*, etc.).  However the first time the application runs it has no knowledge of three items:

- which trends the user wishes to display (pace/elevation/cadence)
- a typical split time/distance for user
- the choice of unit system (metric or imperial)

The user should select the appropriate checkboxes (under the graph) and enter a split time and distance (under Analysis) to complete the process.

After the inital run, these preferences and information will be retained as defaults but can be changed as necessary.

Interactive features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the user-specific settings have been entered, the user may interact with several of the tools contained with the results.  The application has been designed with tooltips to describe most of the tools but there are several features worthy of further description:

- Laps/Splits
	+ Clicking the headers sorts based on that field (distance, pace, etc.)
- Graph
	+ Hovering over the graph displays the Modebar containing a series of icons.
	+ Zooming may be accomplished via click and drag on the graph or via the modebar.
	+ Double clicking the graph returns to the maximum zoom.  There is also a modebar icon to do the same.
	+ Panning may be accomplished via holding shift while clicking the mouse and dragging.
	+ Hovering over the graph will display pop-ups containing the data values.  The map marker will track the position of the runner at a given distance.
- Map
	+ Dragging and dropping the yellow figure on the map will bring up a street view of the position.
	+ Satellite and map views may be toggled by the targets in the upper left.
	+ Click and drag pans across the map independently of the current marker position.
	+ https://support.google.com/maps/answer/144349?hl=e
- Analysis
	+ The user's personal split times is used to calculate VO2max values. Entering new values for the time distance will update the VO2max calculation and the %VO2 gauge.

In addition, transient popup notifications will be displayed at the bottom of the screen when new files are loaded or error messages occur.

Interpreting Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the returned results are labeled to aid in easy interpretation.  However the values for VO2max and VDOT may be unfamiliar to the user.  Wikipedia has a good description for 

+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)#VDOT

Fitplot uses the user's split result as a surrogate for the tests described in the VO2max link.  VDOT is calculated by pace of the user's currently loaded run.  The %VO2 is an indication of the intensity of a run. In the absence of a heart rate measuring device, the %VO2max number can serve to identify if a given run was too fast or slow for a particular training objective (easy run, marathon pace, threshold, interval, or repetition).

The user's VO2max can also be compared to the general population (by age) using the provided table as a means to estimate cardiovascular fitness.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section is not complete yet.

Ending the application
----------------------

Ending the application is performed by clicking on the exit target in the drop down (hamburger) menu.  The application will prompt for confirmation and when it's received, signal the server to stop and close the browser window.  If the help window is also open it will have to be closed manually.

Known Issues
============
The run graph does not support panning via a touchscreen only.  Zooming gestures vary by browser and often take several iterations to accomplish.

+ Google Chrome: Zoom by a single tap with two fingers followed by a single tap with one finger.  No feedback will be given after the inital two finger tap.

+ Mozilla Firefox: Zoom by a single finger tap, hold and drag.

Online Support
==============

Issues
------
The tracking system at Github will be used to report problems and suggest enhancements.  As Fitplot runs under a variety of versions, operating systems, cpu architectures, and browsers, identifying the operating environment is a key to understanding and resolving problems. Please use the hamburger menu (upper left) and select Environment.  Report the browser, operating system, architecture, and the last 4 or 5 digits of the githash when submitting your issue.

+ https://github.com/cprevallet/fitplot/issues

Enhancements
------------
The above tracking system will also be used to identify potential enhancements and improvements.   If you have an idea for improvements, actual source code speaks louder than words.  Let's collaborate!  Create a fork of the Fitplot source code, update it with your changes and issue a pull request at:
