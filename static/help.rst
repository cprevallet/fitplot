Chapter 1 Requirements
======================

Section 1.1 Operating System
----------------------------
Builds are available for Windows 7 (64-bit) and Linux Debian 8 (Jessie - 64 bit).

Section 1.2 Input devices
-------------------------

A mouse or trackpad rather than a touchscreen is recommended in order to pan and scroll 
the graph generated by the application.  A touchscreen may be used other features.

Section 1.3 Browser
-------------------
Fitplot requires access to the internet and a web browser. 

Section 1.3.1 Browser version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In theory, any browser capable of supporting a combination of Plot.ly, Material Design Lite 
components, and Google Charts should be capable of using the application.

In general browsers with the following version numbers or later should be compatible
(but see the tested configurations section below):

+ Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
+ Mozilla Firefox version 31 or above
+ Google Chrome version 31 or above

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 may exhibit results in a degraded mode (.css only vs.
SVG for example) and is *not* officially supported.

Section 1.3.2 Browser settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Javascript and cookies must be enabled to use the application.  This is generally the
out-of-the-box setting for most modern browsers.

Section 1.4 Tested configurations
---------------------------------
Fitplot has been tested under the following combinations of operating system and browser:

- Microsoft Windows 7 (64 bit build) 
	+ Internet Explorer 11
	+ Firefox 47.0.1
	+ Chrome 51.0.2704.103
- Debian GNU/Linux 8 (Jessie - 64 bit) 
	+ Chrome 51.0.2704.106
	+ Firefox 45.2.0
- Apple iOS 9 (client only iPad 2)
	+ Safari

Section 1.5 Input file formats
------------------------------
Fitplot will display files generated in either Garmin's FIT or TCX formats.

Chapter 2 Installation
======================

Installation is a performed simply by copying the files from the delivery medium 
(CD/flash/web download) into a directory/folder on the user's hard drive.  

The program needs write access to a temporary directory (typically 
C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Temp on MS Windows) or (/tmp on Linux). 
Nothing else is required.

Chapter 3 Usage
===============

Section 3.1 Getting the files
-----------------------------

Making a Garmin file available to the PC depends on the individual device:

- Devices using Ant Agent to download files: Forerunner 50, 60, 70, 310XT, 405, 405CX, 410, 610, 910, 910XT, and Garmin Swim

- Devices using a docking cradle to download files: Forerunner/Edge 205 and 305

- Devices using a USB cable to download files: Forerunner/Edge 10, 110, 210, 220, 620, 500, 510, 705, 800, 810, 1000, and 920XT 

A description of the process of moving the file from the watch to the PC is beyond the scope 
of this document but there are a number of descriptions of the process available on 
the Internet.  That said, the newer Garmin devices support the USB option which tends to
be less problematic than older Ant Agent transfers.

Once the files have been transferred to the PC continue to the next step.

Section 3.1.1 File locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ANT+ protocol
	+ Windows 2000 and Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\<USERNAME>\\Application Data\\GARMIN\Devices\\<DEVICE-ID>
	+ Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8: C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\GARMIN\\Devices\\<DEVICE-ID>
	+ Mac OS X: Macintosh HD/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Application Support/Garmin/Devices/<DEVICE-ID>

On Windows computers, the Application Data (AppData) folders are hidden by default and you must enable the display of hidden files before you are able to see these elements.﻿ Please see: 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7
﻿
- USB
	+ Connect your Garmin to the USB cable and ensure the cable is plugged into your computer and wait for your computer to recognize the device.  Files may be loaded directly from the watch in this configuration.
	+ <DRIVE>\\Garmin\\Garmin\\Activity\\

Section 3.2 Starting the application
------------------------------------
Fitplot has both a web server and web client.  Both must be loaded in order to use the
application.  

The server may be started from either the command line or via clicking on the executable 
file (fitplot.exe - Windows, fitplot - Linux).  

Once the server has been started, the user-interface may be generated by opening a supported
browser and typing "http://localhost:8080" (without the quotes) into the address bar.

Section 3.3 Using the application
---------------------------------

Section 3.3.1 Load a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the steps described in "Starting the application" have been performed the user is
presented with a circular green target with the figure of a runner.  The application is
ready to process and display the user's running data.

Pressing the target will present a file input dialog box. Navigate to one of the folders 
containing either a .FIT or .TCX format file and confirm.  

Section 3.3.2 Enter user-specific settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next the file will be processed and most of the results displayed.  However the
first time the application runs it has no knowledge of three items:

- which trends the user wishes to display (pace/elevation/cadence)
- a typical race time/distance for user
- the choice of unit system (metric or imperial)

The user should select the appropriate checkboxes (under Graph) and enter a race time
and distance (under Analysis) to complete the process.

After the inital run, these preferences and information will be retained as defaults but
can be changed as necessary.

Section 3.3.3 Interactive features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the user-specific settings have been entered, the user may interact with several
of the tools contained with the results.  The application has been designed with tooltips
to describe most of the tools but there are several features worthy of further description:

- Laps/Splits
	+ Clicking the headers sorts based on that field (distance, pace, etc.)
- Graph
	+ Hovering over the graph displays the Modebar containing a series of icons.
	+ Zooming may be accomplished via click and drag on the graph or via the modebar.
	+ Double clicking the graph returns to the maximum zoom.  There is also a modebar icon to do the same.
	+ Panning may be accomplished via holding shift while clicking the mouse and dragging.
	+ Hovering over the graph will display pop-ups containing the data values.  The map marker will track the position of the runner at a given distance.
- Map
	+ Dragging and dropping the yellow figure on the map will bring up a street view of the position.
	+ Satellite and map views may be toggled by the targets in the upper left.
	+ Click and drag pans across the map independently of the current marker position.
- Analysis
	+ The user's personal race times is used to calculate VO2max values. Entering new values for the time distance will update the VO2max calculation and the %VO2 gauge.
	
Section 3.3.4 Interpreting Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the returned results are labeled to aid in easy interpretation.  However the values
for VO2max and VDOT may be unfamiliar to the user.  Wikipedia has a good description for
both:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)#VDOT

Fitplot uses the user's race result as a surrogate for the tests described in the VO2max
link.  VDOT is calculated by pace of the user's currently loaded run.  The %VO2 is an
indication of the intensity of a run. In the absence of a heart rate measuring device, the
%VO2max number can serve to identify if a given run was too fast or slow for a particular
training objective (easy run, marathon pace, threshold, interval, or repetition).

The user's VO2max can also be compared to the general population (by age) using the provided 
tables as a means to estimate cardiovascular fitness.


Section 3.4 Troubleshooting
---------------------------

This section is not complete yet.

Section 3.5 Ending the application
----------------------------------
Ending the application is performed in two steps.  Close the browser window and hit 
control-C in the window containing the server.  This may be performed in either order.


Chapter 4 Known Issues
======================
The run graph does not support zooming or panning via a touchscreen only.
