== Installation

Before you start using Fitplot, you have to make it available on your computer.
Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the 
latest version. You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are a number of prerequisites in order to use this application.

* Builds are available for 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows (7 and above) as well as 64-bit Linux distributions. MacOS/OSX builds are not available or supported.  

* A 64-bit Intel-compatible processor.

* Administrator/root privileges are necessary for installation.

* A functioning Internet connection is necessary to use the application.

* A method (USB or ANT) to transfer .FIT or .TCX files to the PC.
====

The latest release builds are available for download here:

https://github.com/cprevallet/fitplot/releases

Fitplot is open source software. The actual program code for this
software to view and modify is online at Github.

https://github.com/cprevallet/fitplot

=== Installing on Windows(64 bit)

Installation is a performed simply by downloading and running 'Fitplot
Windows x64 Setup.exe' as Administrator. The setup executable will display the license and
then prompt for an installation location.

A start menu folder will be created containing links to start and to uninstall Fitplot.

=== Installing on GNU/Linux(64 bit)

Installation is performed by first setting the executable bit on the script and the running it (as root) to copy the files into the /opt/fitplot directory on the user's drive.

A desktop application menu link will be created (under Accessories) to start Fitplot. 

[source,console]

[TIP]
====
How do I know this software hasn't been modified from the original source?

In lieu of a "signing certificate" that both Apple and Microsoft support
within their respective operating systems, Fitplot is offered with a
"message digest" to insure that the application has not been tampered
with. As a result, when installing under Windows, a warning about an unknown publisher may be issued.

The following utilities may be executed from the command line after downloading the builds to verify the provided message digests. Performing this check is optional but a good practice.

* Windows

[source,console]
----
C:\ CertUtil -hashfile 'Fitplot Windows x64 Setup.exe' MD5
----

* Linux

[source,console]
----
$ md5sum fitplot.run
----

The resulting displayed checksum should match the checksum value in the file md_windows.txt or md_linux.txt.

== Running the Application

The application will open displaying the _Stored Runs_ portion of the
application. At this juncture, the user may optionally choose to
<<Loading Runs, load a run>> or <<Selecting a Run, select a run>>
from the database (if loaded previously).

== Loading Runs


Fitplot needs information on your run in the form of files generated
from your Garmin watch. Once
files are available and
subsequently <<Open file(s), opened in the application>>, they are
stored internally in a <<Database, database>> where they serve as a
historical record. Once stored internally, runs may be used directly by
<<Selecting a Run, selecting from a list>> without the need to reload
them each session.

In addition, there are sample FIT and TCX files provided with the
program itself within the directory/folder named "samples". These files
may be loaded to use the application if no additional files are
available.

=== Make Run files Available 
Instructions for making a Garmin file available to the PC vary according
to the model of the individual device:

* Devices using Ant Agent to download files: Forerunner 50, 60, 70,
310XT, 405, 405CX, 410, 610, 910, 910XT, and Garmin Swim
* Devices using a docking cradle to download files: Forerunner/Edge 205
and 305
* Devices using a USB cable to download files: Forerunner/Edge 10, 110,
210, 220, 620, 500, 510, 705, 800, 810, 1000, and 920XT

Detailed instructions describing the process of moving the file from the
watch to the PC for the numerous models Garmin manufactures is beyond
the scope of this document but there are a number of descriptions of the
process https://support.garmin.com/support/manuals/searchManuals.faces?refresh=true[available on the Internet].
Newer Garmin devices support the USB option which tends to be less
problematic than older Ant Agent transfers.

Once the files are transferred to the PC's hard drive or available via
USB continue to <<Open file(s),open files>>.

[TIP]
==== 
[[filelocations]]File locations

* ANT+ protocol::
  ** On Windows computers, the Application Data (AppData) folders are
  hidden by default and you must enable the display of hidden files
  before you are able to see these elements.﻿ Please see:
  http://windows.microsoft.com/enus/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7
  ** Windows 2000 and Windows XP: C:\Documents and
  Settings\<USERNAME>\Application Data\GARMIN\Devices\<DEVICEID>
  ** Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8:
  C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\GARMIN\Devices\<DEVICEID>
* USB::
  ** Connect your Garmin to the USB cable and ensure the cable is
  plugged into your computer and wait for your computer to recognize the
  device. Files may be loaded directly from the watch in this
  configuration.
  ** <DRIVE>\Garmin\Garmin\Activity\
====

=== Open file(s)

Once the application has been started and files are available, the
user may open the files by selecting a circular green target with the
figure of an arrow pointing up.

* Pressing the target will present a file input dialog box.
* Navigate to one of the <<filelocations,folders>> containing either
.FIT or .TCX format files select one or more files to load. (Selecting
more than one file is operating system specific. On Windows or Linux try
holding SHIFT or CTRL while selecting.

* Select Open button to begin the upload process.

Once confirmed Fitplot will load the files in parallel. One or more file
upload notification popup dialogs will appear in series at the bottom
of the browser window indicating the success or failure of the file
load(s). Once the files have loaded, <<Selecting a Run, select a run>>
 to continue.

Note: It is not recommended to load more than about one month's worth of
files (2530) at one time. It is possible under some circumstances for
files to fail to load if this limit is exceeded.


[TIP]
==== 
[[Database]]Database

Runs are stored internally in a database where they serve as a
historical record. The database is stored in a single file named
"fitplot.db" in the (system dependent) application installation
directory. This file is transparent to the user and normally of no
consequence. However, there are a few situations where some knowledge of
the existence of this file may be helpful.

If the database file is not found on application startup (e.g. the first
time the application is used), a blank empty database is created.

If the database file is found on application startup, a backup copy is
made in the systemdependent temporary directory as a safeguard. This
file will be called "tmpxxxxxxxxx" where the values for "x" are random
numbers between from 0 to 9. In the event of a missing or corrupted
database, manually copying and renaming this file to "fitplot.db" in the
installation directory may be sufficient to recover.

Manually copying fitplot.db to another name can serve as a backup
strategy. For example, if the user is only interested in viewing the
runs for one year at a time, storing a single year's worth of data and
then renaming fitplot.db to fitplot_yyyy.db (while the application is
not running, of course) is a viable strategy to store past runs. This
may have the added benefit of avoiding overly long searches from within
Fitplot.

Finally, fitplot.db is an SQLite database and its contents may be viewed
(and exported) from within compatible applications such as the free
http://sqlitebrowser.org/[DB Browser for SQLite].
==== 

== Usage

=== Using the application

==== Selecting a Run

After one or more files have been <<Open file(s), opened>> in the
application, a single run should be selected for visualization or
analysis. This is accomplished in two steps.

The first step is selecting a pair of dates ("Start" and "End") on the
calendar widget provided on the _Stored Runs_ tab. Navigate between
months by left clicking the arrows (previous and next) on the calendar
header bar and then left-clicking the desired day. The selected dates
will appear in the readonly text boxes below the calendar. The dates
represent a range bounding the run(s) of interest. The earliest
("Start") date is _always_ selected first however both dates can be the
same if desired (e.g. a single day). Upon selecting the end date, a
table containing all runs falling between the selected dates will be
returned along with a bar graph indicating the distances for each run.
The bar graph provides a comparison between runs within the selected
dates. Hovering the mouse over the bars will show values (date, time,
distance) for a given run.

The second step is to locate an individual run in the table. Right click
the row containing the run of interest and then click on one of the tabs
(_Visualize_, _Summarize_, or _Analyze_) to see information on that run.
Alternatively leftclick and select from the pop-up menu.

[TIP]
====
Clicking the headers of the table will sort ascending based on
distance, date, pace, moving time, and timeof-day. The bar graph will
reflect the new sort order. This can be handy for locating the longest
run or fastest paced run in a given week or month for example.
====

==== Enter userspecific settings

Next the run will be processed and the results displayed upon selecting
one of the tabs (_Visualize_, _Summarize_, _Analyze_, etc.). However the
first time the application runs it has no knowledge of three items:

* which trends the user wishes to display (pace/elevation/cadence)
* a typical split time/distance for user
* the choice of unit system (metric or imperial)

The user should select the appropriate checkboxes (under the graph) and
enter a split time and distance (under Analysis) to complete the
process.

After the inital run, these preferences and information will be retained
as defaults but can be changed as necessary.

==== Interactive features

After the userspecific settings have been entered, the user may
interact with several of the tools contained with the results. The
application has been designed with tooltips to describe most of the
tools but there are several features worthy of further description:

* Laps/Splits::
  ** Clicking the headers sorts based on that field (distance, pace,
  etc.)
* Graph::
  ** Hovering over the graph displays the Modebar containing a series of
  icons.
  ** Zooming may be accomplished via click and drag on the graph or via
  the modebar.
  ** Double clicking the graph returns to the maximum zoom. There is
  also a modebar icon to do the same.
  ** Panning may be accomplished via holding shift while clicking the
  mouse and dragging.
  ** Hovering over the graph will display popups containing the data
  values. The map marker will track the position of the runner at a
  given distance.
* Map::
  ** Dragging and dropping the yellow figure on the map will bring up a
  street view of the position.
  ** Satellite and map views may be toggled by the targets in the upper
  left.
  ** Click and drag pans across the map independently of the current
  marker position.
  ** https://support.google.com/maps/answer/144349?hl=e
* Analysis::
  ** The user's personal split times is used to calculate VO2max values.
  Entering new values for the time distance will update the VO2max
  calculation and the %VO2 gauge.

In addition, transient popup notifications will be displayed at the
bottom of the screen when new files are loaded or error messages occur.

==== Interpreting Results

Most of the returned results are labeled to aid in easy interpretation.
However the values for VO2max and VDOT may be unfamiliar to the user.
Wikipedia has a good description for

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)#VDOT

Fitplot uses the user's split result as a surrogate for the tests
described in the VO2max link. VDOT is calculated by pace of the user's
currently loaded run. The %VO2 is an indication of the intensity of a
run. In the absence of a heart rate measuring device, the %VO2max number
can serve to identify if a given run was too fast or slow for a
particular training objective (easy run, marathon pace, threshold,
interval, or repetition).

The user's VO2max can also be compared to the general population (by
age) using the provided table as a means to estimate cardiovascular
fitness.
